## Project Description
This project is a part of the assesment for the course Getting and Cleaning of John Hopkins University

##Study design and data processing

*Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
*Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
*Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
*Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
*-From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

###Collection of the raw data
Raw data was downloaded from here  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  

##Description of the variables in the Data_analisys.txt file
General description of the file including:
 - Dimensions of the dataset: 180 rows and 22 columns
 - Summary of the data
 - Variables present in the dataset

(you can easily use Rcode for this, just load the dataset and provide the information directly form the tidy data file)

###Variable 1 (repeat this section for all variables in the dataset)
Short description of what the variable describes.

Some information on the variable including:
 - Class of the variable
 - Unique values/levels of the variable
 - Unit of measurement (if no unit of measurement list this as well)
 - In case names follow some schema, describe how entries were constructed (for example time-body-gyroscope-z has 4 levels of descriptors. Describe these 4 levels). 

(you can easily use Rcode for this, just load the dataset and provide the information directly form the tidy data file)
